## PE-1 — Policy and Procedures

a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
    1. [Selection (one or more): organization-level; mission/business process-level; system-level] physical and environmental protection policy that:
        (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
        (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
    2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the physical and environmental protection policy and the associated physical and environmental protection controls;
b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the physical and environmental protection policy and procedures; and
c. Review and update the current physical and environmental protection:
    1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: organization-defined events] ; and
    2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: organization-defined events].

**Discussion:** Physical and environmental protection policy and procedures address the controls in the PE family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of physical and environmental protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to physical and environmental protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

**Provenance:** NIST SP 800-53r5 · PE-3(7) · rev 5.2.0

## PE-3(8) — Access Control Vestibules

Employ access control vestibules at [Assignment: organization-defined locations].

**Discussion:** An access control vestibule is part of a physical access control system that typically provides a space between two sets of interlocking doors. Vestibules are designed to prevent unauthorized individuals from following authorized individuals into facilities with controlled access. This activity, also known as piggybacking or tailgating, results in unauthorized access to the facility. Interlocking door controllers can be used to limit the number of individuals who enter controlled access points and to provide containment areas while authorization for physical access is verified. Interlocking door controllers can be fully automated (i.e., controlling the opening and closing of the doors) or partially automated (i.e., using security guards to control the number of individuals entering the containment area).

## PE-11 — Emergency Power

Provide an uninterruptible power supply to facilitate [Selection: an orderly shutdown of the system; transition of the system to long-term alternate power] in the event of a primary power source loss.

**Discussion:** An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical system or mechanism that provides emergency power when there is a failure of the main power source. A UPS is typically used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious mission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly shut down the system.

## PE-22 — Component Marking

Mark [Assignment: organization-defined system hardware components] indicating the impact level or classification level of the information permitted to be processed, stored, or transmitted by the hardware component.

**Discussion:** Hardware components that may require marking include input and output devices. Input devices include desktop and notebook computers, keyboards, tablets, and smart phones. Output devices include printers, monitors/video displays, facsimile machines, scanners, copiers, and audio devices. Permissions controlling output to the output devices are addressed in [AC-3](#ac-3) or [AC-4](#ac-4) . Components are marked to indicate the impact level or classification level of the system to which the devices are connected, or the impact level or classification level of the information permitted to be output. Security marking refers to the use of human-readable security attributes. Security labeling refers to the use of security attributes for internal system data structures. Security marking is generally not required for hardware components that process, store, or transmit information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable. However, organizations may require markings for hardware components that process, store, or transmit public information in order to indicate that such information is publicly releasable. Marking of system hardware components reflects applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.
